# What's Cookin' Good Lookin'

## Project Overview

What's Cookin' Good Lookin' is an application that presents a user with an extensive list of recipes. Users can favorite recipes, save recipes to the 'Let's Cook' section, and delete from their favorites. All recipes include ingredients needed, directions, and cost. On page load, a random user will be generated and they can then interact with the page.

## See it in action!
- Upon opening the application, the user is greeted and will see all recipes displayed. They may also search by recipe name or ingredient or filter by recipe type.
